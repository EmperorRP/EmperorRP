# Hello, world!

I am EmperorRP, and I love blockchain and design. I develop code in Solidity to make my Decentralized Applications (Dapps). I have attached my two latest projects at the end for you to see. 

I am constantly studying and working on blockchain related stuff by developing effective solutions and training myself to find and fix the problems I see.
